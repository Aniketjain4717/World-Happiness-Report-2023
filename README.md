# World-Happiness-Report-2023


🚀 Just wrapped up a data visualization project using the World Happiness Report 2023 dataset in Tableau!
 🌍 138 countries, 19 variables — including GDP, health, social support, freedom, and more.
🔍 What I did:
 📌 Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (handled missing values, grouped countries into continents, normalized scores)
 📊 Created powerful visualizations:
🔟 Top 10 Happiest Countries (Bar Chart)
💸 Happiness Score vs. GDP (Scatter Plot)
🗺️ Social Support by Country (Map, color-coded by continent)
🥧 Share of Countries by Region (Pie Chart)
✨ Built interactive dashboards with:
Filters for Continent and GDP per Capita
Dynamic hover tooltips showing all scores per country
Highlights for Top & Bottom 10 Countries
Correlation analysis between Healthy Life Expectancy and other factors
🧠 It was exciting to see how data can tell a story about global well-being!
